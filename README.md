A digital platform called the Student E-Profile was created to present a student's academic and personal history in an engaging and well-organized way. This e-profile guarantees a visually beautiful and user-friendly experience because it was developed with HTML for structure and Bootstrap for a responsive and contemporary front-end.

CSS is used to improve styling, giving the site a clean, businesslike appearance. Java is also used to incorporate dynamic features, which enhances the profile's functionality and interactivity. Student data is stored and retrieved with ease using JSON for effective data management.

Students may efficiently keep and show their academic and personal information using this project, which is easy to use and accessible.
